        "\n",
        "Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simple syntax and readability.\n",
        "It is popular because it is easy to learn, has a large standard library, strong community support, and is widely used in fields like web development, data science, AI, automation, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An interpreter is a program that reads Python code line-by-line and executes it directly.\n",
        "It helps in debugging and rapid development because you don't need to compile the code first.\n",

        "\n",
        "# 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning and functionality.\n",
        "Examples: if, else, elif, def, return, True, False, etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "# 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved by the language for specific functions.\n",
        "For example, using 'if' or 'for' as a variable name will result in a syntax error.\n",

        "# 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",

        "# 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",

        "# 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
